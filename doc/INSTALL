CamlImages - Objective Caml image processing library

This library is reliable but currently under development.

*** Requirements

 To install CamlImages library, you need the following softwares:

        * ocaml 3.04 or higher
        * GNU make

and that is all. But note that this is the minimum requirement: you
can read/write BMP or PXM (PPM, PGM, PBM) image formats but no other
formats. If you want to deal with other image formats, you need to
install the corresponding external libraries:

        * libpng for PNG format
                ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/src/

        * libjpeg for JPEG format
                The Independent JPEG Group's software
                ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz

        * libtiff for TIFF format
                Sam Leffler's TIFF software
                ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/tiff-v3.4-tar.gz

        * libxpm for XPM format
                X contrib libraries ftp directory
                fftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries

        * freetype for drawing texts using truetype fonts
                The FREETYPE Project
                http://www.freetype.org/
                or
                http://freetype.sourceforge.net/

                Note:
                        You need either version 1.3.1 or Version 2.0.x.

        * libungif for GIF format
                Because of the GIF patent problem of Unisys, we do not
                recommend to use GIF file format. If you really want to
                use GIF, do it in your own risk.

                Libungif, a library for using GIFs without compression.

        * ghostscript for PS format
                See http://www.ghostscript.com/

Even though you do not have one of these libraries, all the functions of
CamlImages are still available, but they may raise an exception
Failure "??? is not supported"

*** Installation procedure

 Configuration
 -------------
  To compile and install the CamlImages library, first configure the
the library using the script configuration appropriate to your architecture:
this script searches whether external libraries exist or not and where
they are, and configure automatically your Makefile, config.h,
camlimages.ml and so on.

Some specialized configuration scripts are:
  configure_FreeBSD : to configure a FreeBSD box
  configure_OpenBSD : to configure an OpenBSD box.

Otherwise simply run:

        % ./configure


  If you have installed the lablgtk library (CVS version):

   http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html

and if it is in the standard place, $CAMLDIR/lablgtk, then the
configuration script automatically finds it and configures your
Makefile. If you installed lablgtk in another place, you have
to specify it using the option:

--with-lablgtk=LABLGTKDIR

to enable the compilation of the examples using the lablgtk GUI
library. (LABLGTKDIR stands for the absolute path of the directory
where lablgtk resides.)

 Compilation
 -----------
 type

        % make

and wait.

 Test
 ----
  Before you actually install the library, you can check that it
really works, by running examples in the test directory. For the test
programs,

        % cd test
        % make
        % ./test
        % ./test.byt

(./test.byt is the bytecode executable and ./test the binary
executable). We hope it works for you.

 Installation
 ------------

  If there is no compilation error and the test works fine,
install the library,

        % make install

This installs all the required files into the $(LIBDIR) directory
specified in Makefile.config (usually /usr/local/lib/ocaml/camlimages
or /usr/lib/ocaml/camlimages).

  If you want to create a toplevel with camlimages,

        % make top

that creates a toplevel named "customtop". Then,

        % toplevel

executes customtop with the appropriate options.

 Example applications
 --------------------

  In the examples directory you can find several example applications
using Camlimages.

  Some of the programs use the lablgtk GUI (in particular liv and
gifanim): you cannot compile them if the lablgtk library has not
been installed.

  To compile the examples execute:

        % cd examples
        % make
